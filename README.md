# Lines

The game starts with a 9Ã—9 board with 3 balls chosen out of 5 different colors. 
The player can move one ball per turn, and the player may only move a ball to a particular place 
if there is a path (linked set of vertical and horizontal empty cells) between the current position 
of the ball and the desired destination. Attainable cells are highlighted by grey color.

The goal is to remove balls by forming lines (horizontal or vertical) 
of five balls of the same color. If the player forms such lines of five balls of the same color, 
the balls in those lines disappear, and he gains 10 points. 
If not, 3 new balls are added, and the game continues until the board is full.
